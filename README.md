WIP roguelike game inspired by Pokemon/Final Fantasy battles.
I have created simple 2d engine. SFML was used as a solution for game window, sprite rendering, vector math and playing sounds (yet to be implemented). I just finished must-have engine work that features gameObjects, component system and scene management logic.
